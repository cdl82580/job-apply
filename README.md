## Features

### Agent
- **Master Resume Builder** — guided Q&A wizard for users who don't have a master resume yet (or want to rebuild one): repeatable job/education/certification entries with add/remove bullet-point rows, one of three original DOCX templates (Technical/ATS-Clean, Traditional/Chronological, Executive/Leadership with a competency grid), optional single Claude polish pass that tightens wording without inventing facts or numbers. Smart input fields: native email/URL validation, live phone number formatting as-you-type (`libphonenumber-js`, national format per country), month/year date pickers for job dates, and search-as-you-type autocomplete for city fields (OpenStreetMap Nominatim, proxied server-side) and the education institution field (US Dept of Education College Scorecard, falling back to the Hipolabs universities API for schools outside the US — results show a logo.dev thumbnail, name/alias, and city/state/country). Generating a new resume saves it directly as the user's live master resume; if one already exists, generating a new one requires explicit overwrite confirmation and automatically keeps the replaced version as a one-slot backup (downloadable and restorable from the Profile page — see Auth & Accounts below). Pinned as the first card on the Agent page since it's the prerequisite for every other agent.
- **Tailored resume** — styled DOCX with brand colors, targeted bullets, competency grid; edits are applied by field (tagline, summary, each competency cell, each job's title/bullets) derived from that user's own master resume, not a fixed set of employer names or a fixed competency-grid shape — works with whatever jobs/bullets/cells their resume actually has, including resumes built through the Master Resume Builder wizard
- **ATS resume** — plain single-column DOCX, no tables or text boxes, parser-safe; content — including the candidate's own name and contact line — is parsed verbatim from the tailored styled resume's XML (`scripts/gen_ats_from_styled.py`) rather than generated separately, so the two documents can't drift out of sync and never show a different user's identity
- **Cover letter** — voice-matched DOCX tailored to the role and hiring manager; signed with the candidate's own name and contact line, read from their resume header
- **Application Questions** — answer freeform application questions (e.g. "Describe a time you led a cross-functional team") using tailored resume, JD, and profile context; tone selector (professional/conversational/technical/concise), optional character limit, two-phase clarification flow (agent can ask follow-ups before answering), editable answer with copy-to-clipboard and refinement chips
- **Thank You Email** — post-interview thank-you email generator with app picker, round/tone selectors, optional interviewer name and key topics discussed; outputs editable email with subject line, copy-to-clipboard, DOCX download, and Google Drive upload
- **Interview Prep** — single-column, 2-page flowing DOCX (0.5" margins) with 6 numbered sections separated by rules: elevator pitch (~45-second spoken script + delivery/adapt-live notes), role & company snapshot (role, size/funding, leadership, stack, "how to read this company"), your story mapped to the company's own stated pillars/priorities, likely Q&A (ending on the single hardest/most probing question), smart questions to ask, and before-the-interview prep actions. Content is calibrated internally to the round type and focus/slant. Header shows the company logo (via logo.dev — same source used for logos everywhere else in the app, and it renders a light-on-dark card so a company whose only mark is a light/white logo still shows up against the doc's white background), interviewer(s) — one per line, freeform (name/role/LinkedIn, etc.) — and a Date · Time · Location logistics line, each part shown only if provided. Any `http(s)://` or `www.` URL anywhere in the header (LinkedIn profile, video-call link) is automatically rendered as a real clickable hyperlink, not plain text. Headers and dividers are tinted with the company's brand colors (primary + a real secondary accent, both via Brandfetch, falling back to the app's default navy/teal; a color too light to read as text against the white page is automatically darkened, preserving hue, before use — same safeguard applies to the resume and cover letter's brand-colored text). When the run is tied to a tracked application (`app_id`), Brandfetch is queried using that application's already-resolved domain rather than a fuzzy company-name search — a name search can match the wrong company entirely for a common/ambiguous name. Proof points restricted to roles/projects within the last 10 years, per the dates in the user's own resume — no hardcoded employer list.
- **Humanizer prompts** — each text-producing agent has a tailored humanizer directive: Voice Builder (resume/cover letter), Natural Flow Editor (interview prep), AI Pattern Remover (optimize resume), Human Rewrite (optimize cover letter), Authenticity Check (application questions), Voice Builder (thank you email)
- **GitHub portfolio** — FlowShift, task-api, and job-apply repos injected into every prep prompt as additional proof points
- **JD persistence** — job description saved as `job_description.md` to Google Drive on every run; when a JD is pasted and the run completes the file is written to the output folder and a `job_description` run is linked to the application so it auto-loads on subsequent runs and prep
- **Google Drive sync** — all output files uploaded automatically to your Drive folder; PDF version generated via Drive conversion; re-running the agent for the same company/role upserts files in place by name (keeps file IDs/share links stable) instead of creating duplicate copies
- **SSE progress streaming** — live log output while the agent runs; `done` event includes `replacements_warning` if XML edits partially failed
- **Machine pinning** — `machine_id` returned from POST endpoints; client sets `fly-force-instance-id` cookie before opening EventSource to guarantee SSE stream hits the same Fly.io machine
- **bfcache prevention** — Web Lock acquired on page load keeps all HTML pages ineligible for Chrome's back/forward cache; server-side middleware also injects `no-store` headers, `<meta>` cache tags, and a `pageshow` reload script into every HTML response
- **Branding asset cache-busting** — `favicon.png` and `img/{logo.png,logo-dark.png,logo-light.png,chat-icon.png,teams-color-icon.png,teams-outline-icon.png,slack-app-icon.png}` get the same `no-store` treatment as HTML (see `_NO_CACHE_PATHS` in `api.py`), since these filenames get overwritten in place whenever the logo/icon is redesigned and would otherwise serve stale cached bytes indefinitely

### Application Tracker
- Full CRUD for job applications — company (via Logo.dev search), role, status, recruiter, salary, DUA tracking
- **Match scoring** — Claude-powered resume↔JD fit score (0–100) with category badge (Strong Match / Good Match / Stretch / Long Shot) and per-dimension breakdown; Rescore button per row
- **DUA indicator** — tag and filter applications reported to unemployment (DUA)
- **Auto `date_applied`** — setting status to "Applied" automatically sets today's date if not already present
- **Run agent from tracker** — ▶ icon on each row opens the agent page with the app pre-selected and JD loaded from Drive
- **Setup Drive folder** — ⊕ icon on rows without a Drive folder creates the folder and attempts JD capture from the posting URL in the background
- Comments/notes system per application with timestamped history
- Linked agent runs — automatically links generated resumes/prep docs to applications; editing the posting URL re-captures the JD
- Sorting, filtering (status, match score, DUA, search), pagination
- CSV and formatted Excel export with frozen headers and alternating rows

### Calendar
- Create, view, update, and delete calendar events (interviews, deadlines, follow-ups, custom)
- Reminders via email (Resend) and/or Slack DM — configurable offset in minutes, multi-channel
- Per-user event cap (1,000); per-event reminder cap (10)
- Events linkable to application tracker records and run IDs
- Accessible from the web UI (`/calendar.html`) and all `/cal-*` Slack commands

### Auth & Accounts
- Email/password auth with scrypt hashing and HMAC-signed stateless session cookies (30-day TTL)
- **Google OAuth** — sign in with Google; auto-links to existing email/password accounts
- **Email verification** via Resend — verification banner shown until confirmed; all emails sent from `hello@cdlav.us`
- **Email change** — requires current password; triggers re-verification; invalidates existing session
- Role-based access: `user` and `admin` roles
- Admin accounts restricted to the admin dashboard only
- Per-request session validation checks `active` flag and password-change fingerprint (`pwv`)
- **Master resume backup** — every time the master resume is overwritten (manual upload, Slack/Teams DM, or the Resume Builder wizard), the previous version is automatically kept in a single backup slot; the Profile page shows a download link and a "Restore this version" button (restoring is a symmetric swap, not a delete, so it can be undone by restoring again)
- **Profile & Voice Guide wizard** — the profile guide (`profile.md`) is built through a 6-step guided wizard (Identity, Contact, Voice & Tone Rules, Key Stories, Preferences, Review) instead of a raw textarea, shared between `profile.html` and the registration flow (`register.html`, minus AI suggestions — no resume is on the server yet at signup). Identity and Key Stories steps have a "✨ Suggest" button that drafts from the user's actual master resume via `POST /api/profile/suggest`; Voice & Tone Rules comes prefilled with sensible defaults. An existing profile's markdown is best-effort parsed back into wizard fields on first open (anything that doesn't map to a known section, e.g. custom text or old Career Timeline/Skills sections, is preserved verbatim in an "Additional Notes" block rather than dropped). A "raw markdown" toggle on `profile.html` remains for power users; switching modes round-trips losslessly. Structured wizard answers are cached separately (`profile_fields.json`) so re-opening the wizard doesn't need to re-parse markdown — any `profile_text`-only write (raw-markdown save, or the Slack/Teams `/profile-guide` commands) clears that cache so it can't go stale.

### Security
- `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `Referrer-Policy` on every response
- Rate limiting on login (10/min), register (5/hr), resend-verification (3/hr), change-password (5/hr), change-email (5/hr), resume-upload (10/hr), forgot-password (3/hr), reset-password (5/hr), company search (30/min)
- SSRF guard on webhook URLs (DNS resolution + private-net check, shared via `scripts/ssrf.py`), re-applied at delivery time. Delivery pins the connection to the exact IP that resolution validated (`resolve_safe_ip()` + `post_pinned()`) instead of letting the HTTP client re-resolve independently, closing the DNS-rebinding gap a separate check-then-connect step would leave open; outbound webhook delivery does not follow redirects. Admin-supplied custom headers can't set `Host` (domain-fronting)
- Webhook HMAC secrets encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM (key derived from `SESSION_SECRET`; fails fast if unset)
- `safeHref()`/`esc()` applied to all user-supplied URLs and text rendered as `href`/`src`/`innerHTML` in the frontend; KB article HTML sanitized client-side with DOMPurify (`frontend/dompurify.min.js`) before rendering
- Password-reset tokens are single-use (bound to a password-hash fingerprint at issuance; invalidated the moment the password changes)
- Google Drive folder IDs are verified against the caller's actual Drive folders before being accepted into an application's linked runs
- Uploaded DOCX files are capped at 100 MB decompressed and hard-rejected on any DOCTYPE/malformed XML (no silent fallback)
- Audit log stored as individual S3 objects (atomic writes, no cross-machine race condition)
- Per-user record cache (30s TTL) avoids S3 round-trips on every authenticated request

### Admin Dashboard
- **Users** — manage all accounts, email verification, role, active/deactivated status; view runs count, last login, joined date; search, filter, sort, paginate
- **All Applications** — cross-user application oversight with full filtering, sorting, pagination, and Excel/CSV export
- **All Agent Runs** — persistent `AgentRun` records in S3 (`agent-runs/users/{user_id}/{run_id}.json`) with type, status, timing, Drive links, and scoring data; filters, sort, export
- **Audit Log** — unified event log across user and application events; server-side pagination, filter by event ID, action, actor, source, date range
- **Webhooks** — create and manage outbound webhooks for event streaming to Slack, MS Teams, Grafana Loki, and custom endpoints
- **Knowledge Base** — create, edit, and delete KB articles and categories; Quill WYSIWYG editor with Source/Preview toggle; seed KB from frontend constants; filter by category or search
- Admin pages have a dedicated header nav (wrench icon → admin dashboard, no tracker/agents/calendar links); lazy loading and mobile card layout on the users table

### Webhooks
- Event-driven delivery for every audit action
- Payload formats: Generic JSON, Slack Block Kit, MS Teams MessageCard, Grafana Loki
- Delivery filters: actor (email/user ID), source, action category, application ID
- HMAC-SHA256 signing (`X-Hub-Signature-256`) for receiver verification; secret encrypted at rest
- Per-webhook delivery history (last 25), stats, test button
- SSRF guard re-applied at delivery time, with the delivery connection pinned to the exact resolved IP (DNS rebinding protection — see Security section above)

### Knowledge Base
- Public KB at `/kb.html` — searchable article library with category sidebar; articles rendered from HTML body (Quill output)
- Admin-managed via the Knowledge Base tab in `/admin.html`
- Quill WYSIWYG editor with Source/Preview toggle in the article drawer
- Categories with icon (emoji), label, description, and optional `adminOnly` flag
- Seed endpoint (`POST /api/admin/kb/seed-from-file`) re-extracts the built-in article set from `frontend/kb.html`'s `const KB = {...}` literal, parsed directly in Python (`scripts/js_object_parser.py`) rather than via Node/`eval()`
- Stored as a single JSON blob in Tigris (`kb/data.json`); seed data auto-applied if no blob exists yet

### Support Chatbot
- Floating chat widget (Chainlit Copilot) on every authenticated app page — `agents.html`, `tracking.html`, `admin.html`, `profile.html`, `calendar.html`, `api-docs.html`, and `kb.html` (gated behind a login check there, since that page is public)
- Mounted in-process at `/chat` via `chainlit.utils.mount_chainlit` — same FastAPI process/machine as the rest of the web app, no separate Fly process group
- Auth bridges the existing `session` cookie: `chainlit_app.py`'s `header_auth_callback` re-verifies it with the same HMAC secret as `api.py` (`scripts/session.py`) and carries the user's role into the chat session
- Answers are grounded in the Knowledge Base only — visible articles are filtered by the same `adminOnly` rule as `kb.html` (admin-only KB content never reaches a non-admin chat session), then stuffed into the system prompt fresh at chat start (no vector store)
- Admin sessions additionally get the full `README.md` (architecture, deployment, Slack/Teams command reference) as reference material — regular users never see it
- Branded with the app's brand colors (`public/theme.json`); the default Chainlit header logo is hidden since it didn't fit the widget's compact size
- `public/copilot-overrides.css` (loaded via `mountChainlitWidget`'s `customCssUrl`, served by Chainlit itself at `/chat/public/copilot-overrides.css`) fixes the vendored widget's `100vh`-based sizing — mobile Safari's address bar makes that unreliable in portrait — and widens the panel on small screens
- Requires `CHAINLIT_AUTH_SECRET` (Chainlit's own JWT signing secret — see Deployment) in addition to the existing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Silent escalation: the model has a `flag_for_team` tool it calls when it can't answer from the KB, or the user reports a bug or leaves feedback. Before calling it for a bug or unanswerable question, it asks one short clarifying follow-up first (page/action, whether it's reproducible, error text, screenshot); straightforward feedback skips that. This fires a Resend email (to `SUPPORT_NOTIFY_EMAIL`, default `cdl825@gmail.com`) with the reason, a summary, and the full conversation transcript so far — the bot never mentions this to the user, it just acknowledges naturally. `reply_to` is set to the user's own email, so replying in the team's inbox reaches them directly; repeated escalations in the same chat session are threaded into one email via `Message-ID`/`In-Reply-To`/`References`. Rate-limited separately (3/hour/user) from the general chat rate limit
- Screenshots/files the user attaches are read into memory immediately (Chainlit's on-disk copies don't outlive the session) and forwarded as email attachments on escalation (capped at 5 files / 8MB each); images are also passed to Claude as vision content so it can actually see what the user attached
- Every conversation is persisted to Tigris (`chat-logs/{user_id}/{conversation_id}.json` + a per-user `_index.json` for fast listing — see `scripts/chat_logs.py`) and viewable admin-only via the **Chat Logs** tab in `/admin.html` (`routers/chat_logs.py`), including the full transcript, any escalations, and a hint pointing you at the threaded escalation email in your inbox to reply from (a mailto link can't carry `Message-ID`/`In-Reply-To` headers, so it can't thread — replying to the actual notification email does, via the `reply_to` set above)

### Slack Bot
See [Slack Commands](#slack-commands) section below.

### Teams Bot
See [Teams Commands](#teams-commands) section below. Unlike the Slack bot (which
always acts as the single primary account, and — via a global Bolt middleware
keyed on `SLACK_NOTIFY_USER_ID` — is restricted to that one Slack user ID so no
other workspace member/guest can act on it), the Teams bot resolves *which*
Landed account it's acting on behalf of per Teams user — see that section
for the identity-linking flow. `frontend/privacy.html` and `frontend/terms.html`
are served unauthenticated at `/privacy` and `/terms` — Teams' permission-consent
dialog fetches the manifest's `privacyUrl`/`termsOfUseUrl` directly and gets stuck
in a loop if either 404s or redirects to login.

### Test Runner Bot
`test_runner_bot.py` is a standalone Slack app (own bot token, signing secret,
and Socket Mode app token — see `TEST_RUNNER_BOT_TOKEN`/`TEST_RUNNER_SIGNING_SECRET`/
`TEST_RUNNER_APP_TOKEN`), kept separate because the main bot is at Slack's
25-command limit. Restricted to the single Slack user ID in
`TEST_RUNNER_SLACK_USER_ID`. Unlike `web` and `bot`, its Fly machine is **not**
always-on and has no auto-stop — start it manually before using it, and stop
it manually when you're done to avoid leaving it running unnecessarily:
```bash
fly machine start <testrunner-machine-id> --app job-apply-corey
fly machine stop  <testrunner-machine-id> --app job-apply-corey
```

> **Not currently configured on the live app.** As of this writing, none of
> `TEST_RUNNER_BOT_TOKEN`, `TEST_RUNNER_SIGNING_SECRET`, `TEST_RUNNER_APP_TOKEN`,
> or `TEST_RUNNER_SLACK_USER_ID` are set as Fly secrets. Starting the machine
> without them crash-loops `test_runner_bot.py` (`KeyError: 'TEST_RUNNER_BOT_TOKEN'`)
> until Fly's max-restart count is hit, then it parks itself `stopped`. To make
> `/run-tests`/`/test-status` work, create the separate "Test Runner" Slack app,
> grab its bot token / signing secret / Socket Mode app token, then:
> ```bash
> fly secrets set TEST_RUNNER_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-..." TEST_RUNNER_SIGNING_SECRET="..." \
>   TEST_RUNNER_APP_TOKEN="xapp-..." TEST_RUNNER_SLACK_USER_ID="U..." --app job-apply-corey
> ```
> (setting a secret redeploys automatically).

Two commands:
- `/run-tests [unit | api | slack | all | ui-anon | ui | ui-admin]` — runs the
  matching pytest suite in a background thread and streams a live-updating
  result message (one run at a time; a concurrency guard rejects overlapping
  runs). UI suites drive Playwright against `UI_BASE_URL` using `UI_TEST_EMAIL`/
  `UI_TEST_PASSWORD`/`UI_ADMIN_EMAIL`/`UI_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
- `/test-status` — reports whether a suite is currently running.

## Agents at a Glance

Seven distinct Claude-powered agents. Six are triggerable from the web app plus
Slack/Teams (CLI is resume-only); the Master Resume Builder is web-only since it's
a first-time setup flow, not something you'd run mid-conversation in a bot:

| Agent | What it produces | Web (Agent tab) | Slack | Teams | API |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Master Resume Builder** | A brand-new master resume DOCX from a guided Q&A wizard, saved as your live master resume | Build Master Resume | — | — | `POST /api/resume-builder` |
| **Resume + ATS + Cover Letter** | Tailored resume DOCX, ATS-safe resume DOCX, cover letter DOCX | Generate | `/apply` | `apply` | `POST /api/run` |
| **Application Questions** | Answer to a freeform application question, with clarification follow-ups | Application Questions | `/aq` | `aq` | `POST /api/aq` |
| **Interview Prep** | 2-page interview prep reference DOCX | Interview Prep | `/prep` | `prep` | `POST /api/prep` |
| **Thank You Email** | Post-interview thank-you email + DOCX | Thank You Email | `/thankyou` | `thankyou` | `POST /api/thankyou` |
| **Optimize** | In-place revision of an existing run's resume/cover letter from a freeform instruction | Optimize | `/optimize` | `optimize` | `POST /api/optimize` |
| **Rescore (Match Scoring)** | Resume↔JD fit score (0–100), category, and per-dimension breakdown | Tracker row → Score/Rescore button | `/rescore` | `rescore` | `POST /api/applications/{id}/score` |

The six job-application agents require a job description resolvable from a tracked
application (either a saved `job_description.md` in its Drive folder, or its posting
URL) except the first run of `apply`, which also accepts a pasted job posting directly.
The Master Resume Builder needs no JD at all — it only needs your work history, entered
directly in the wizard. See the KB's
["All the Agents"](https://apply.cdlav.us/kb.html#gs-agents-overview) article
for a plain-language walkthrough, or the per-command sections below ([Slack Commands](#slack-commands),
[Teams Commands](#teams-commands)) for exact syntax.

## Web App Usage

1. Go to https://apply.cdlav.us/ — public marketing/landing page (`frontend/index.html`); logged-in visitors are auto-redirected to `/tracking.html` (or `/admin.html`)
2. Register (email/password or Google), upload `master.docx` (or use the **Build Master Resume** wizard on the Agent tab if you don't have one yet), and answer the guided **Profile & Voice Guide** wizard
3. **Agent tab** — paste a job posting, enter company + role, hit **Generate**; use **Application Questions** to draft answers to supplemental app questions; or use **Interview Prep** for a prep doc
4. **Tracker tab** — track applications, add notes, link to agent runs
5. **Calendar tab** — view and manage interview events and deadlines with Slack/email reminders
6. **Knowledge Base** (`/kb.html`) — searchable help articles; admin-managed via the KB tab in the admin dashboard
7. **API Reference** (`/api-docs.html`) — full endpoint browser rendered from the Postman collection, with a ⬇ download button for the collection JSON
8. **Profile** — update display name, email, password, profile guide (guided wizard, or raw markdown), and resume
9. Admins are redirected to `/admin.html` automatically

### Build Master Resume
- For users with no master resume on file yet — the card auto-expands and is pinned first on the Agent tab until you have one
- Guided wizard: résumé style (Technical/ATS-Clean, Traditional/Chronological, or Executive/Leadership), contact info, repeatable work-experience entries (each with add/remove bullet-point rows), education, certifications, skills
- Smart fields: native email/URL validation, live phone formatting as you type, month/year pickers for job dates, and search-as-you-type autocomplete for city fields and the education institution field (shows a logo, name, and city/state/country — pick a result or keep typing freely, e.g. "Remote")
- Optional single AI polish pass tightens wording without inventing facts, numbers, or achievements you didn't provide
- On completion the DOCX is both offered as a direct download and saved as your live master resume — every other agent can use it immediately, no separate upload step
- If you already have a master resume, generating a new one asks for confirmation and automatically keeps the replaced version as a downloadable/restorable backup (see Profile page)

### Application Questions
- Select an existing tracker application — requires a saved `job_description.md` in the app's Drive folder
- Paste the question from the application form, choose a tone, and optionally set a character limit
- The agent may ask clarifying questions before generating (e.g., "Which project should I highlight?") — answer them and it refines
- Output: editable answer with live character count, copy to clipboard, and follow-up refinement chips

### Interview Prep
- Select an existing tracker application — requires a saved `job_description.md` in the app's Drive folder (run the resume agent first if it doesn't exist)
- Enter interview round and optional focus/slant; company and role auto-fill from the selected application
- Optional: interviewer(s) (freeform, one per line — name/role/LinkedIn, etc.), date, time, location (address or video call link) — each shown in the doc header only if provided
- Output: single-column 2-page DOCX uploaded to Drive and available for download, with company logo and brand colors in the header when Brandfetch has data for the company

The bot also publishes a dynamic **App Home tab** showing live pipeline stats, upcoming calendar events, and a quick command reference — opens when you click the app's Home tab in Slack.

**`/apply`/`/prep`/`/aq` only run against a tracked application** — same constraint as the Teams bot. Each modal's "Application" field is a `static_select` populated from `/api/applications` instead of free-text company/role. Submitting looks up a saved job posting from the application's most recently linked Drive folder (`_get_saved_job_posting`); if one exists, the run starts immediately, otherwise Slack updates the same modal in place (`response_action: "update"`, with the already-collected fields carried forward via `private_metadata`) to ask for the JD once.

**Resume upload via DM:** Drop a `.docx` file into a DM with the bot to update your master resume. The bot validates the file is a valid ZIP archive and runs it through `pandoc` to verify it can extract usable text (≥200 characters) — the same path the agents use at runtime. If validation fails, you'll get a warning with instructions to re-export.

| 🛠️ System | `help` | Command reference |

**Identity linking:** the Teams bot has no built-in notion of "logged in." The first
time a Teams user runs any command other than `help`/`confirm`/`unlink`, the bot
looks up a `teams_links/{aad_object_id}.json` record in Tigris (`scripts/teams_links.py`).
If missing or expired, it fetches the caller's email via the Bot Framework's
`TeamsInfo.get_member()` roster API, checks whether a Landed account exists for
that email, and — if so — asks the user to reply `confirm`. Only after that explicit
confirmation does it persist the link (30-day expiry, then re-confirmation is
required). Every subsequent API call the bot makes on that user's behalf carries an
`X-Teams-User-Email` header so `api.py:_bot_user()` resolves that specific account
instead of the shared primary account the Slack bot uses.

**`apply`/`prep`/`aq`/`thankyou` only run against a tracked application** —
there's no free-text company/role entry. Each form's "Application" field is
an Adaptive Card dynamic typeahead searching the caller's own tracked
applications, backed by an `application/search` invoke handler
(`teams_bot/bot.py:_search_my_applications`) since the Bot Framework Python SDK
doesn't dispatch that invoke name itself. Teams' dynamic-search response
schema only supports `{title, value}` per result (no icon/image field), so
the company logo can't appear in the dropdown itself — it shows once an
application is picked, on whichever card the selection lands on. Submitting
the application picks up a saved `job_description.md` from the application's
most recently linked Drive folder automatically if one exists; otherwise a
follow-up card asks the user to paste the job posting once, and that gets
used for the run.

**`track update`/`track note`/`track delete`** mirror the Slack modal flows:
`track update` is two steps (pick an application, then edit a form pre-filled
from the current record — status, date applied, job source, location, salary,
URL, DUA flag, recruiter, plus an optional note) via `PUT /api/applications/{id}`;
`track note` posts a comment via `POST /api/applications/{id}/comments`; `track
delete` shows a destructive-styled confirm card before calling
`DELETE /api/applications/{id}`.

**`cal today`/`cal week`/`cal add`/`cal view`/`cal delete`** mirror Slack's
`/cal-*` commands against the same `/api/calendar` endpoints. `cal add`
simplifies Slack's reminder-channel checkbox (email + Slack) down to a single
"Email reminder" toggle, since there's no Teams-side reminder delivery channel
implemented server-side to pair with it. Local date/time + IANA timezone are
converted to UTC client-side (`_local_to_utc_iso`, same approach as
slack_bot.py's `_local_to_utc_iso`) before being sent to the API.

**`profile resume` uploads via a direct file attachment**, not a slash-command
argument — attach a `.docx` to the chat and `_handle_file_upload` picks it up
automatically. This requires `"supportsFiles": true` in
`teams_bot/manifest/manifest.json` (already set); Teams sends a
`FileDownloadInfo` attachment with a pre-authenticated `downloadUrl` that the
bot can fetch directly, no bearer token needed (unlike Slack, whose file
download requires the bot token). `company`, `profile guide`, and
`notifications` mirror their Slack counterparts directly against
`/api/companies/search` and `PUT /api/profile`.

## Local Development

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt && npm install

export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export SESSION_SECRET=any-random-string
export CHAINLIT_AUTH_SECRET=...  # generate with: python -m chainlit create-secret

# Tigris S3 (user accounts, resumes, profiles, tracker data)
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3=https://fly.storage.tigris.dev
export BUCKET_NAME=job-apply-corey

open http://localhost:8000
```

---

## Google Drive Setup (one-time)

```bash
# Download OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console
# APIs & Services → Credentials → Create → OAuth client ID → Desktop app
# Save as: gdrive_credentials.json (project root)
python3 setup_gdrive.py

# On Fly.io — push token as a secret:
fly secrets set GDRIVE_TOKEN_JSON="$(cat ~/.config/job-apply/gdrive_token.json)"
```

---

## Google OAuth Setup (one-time)

1. Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client → Web application
2. Authorized redirect URI: `https://apply.cdlav.us/api/auth/google/callback`
3. `fly secrets set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=... GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...`

---

## Deployment (Fly.io)

```bash
fly deploy --app job-apply-corey
```

The app runs as **three process groups** on Fly.io (defined in `fly.toml`), each scaled to **1 machine**:

| Process | Command | Machine | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `web` | `uvicorn api:app …` | 1 GB, auto-stop | FastAPI web server — 1 machine required (SSE state is in-memory) |
| `bot` | `python slack_bot.py` | 512 MB, always-on | Slack Socket Mode bot (needs Playwright/Chromium for UI tests) |
| `testrunner` | `python test_runner_bot.py` | 512 MB, started manually | Standalone test-runner bot — separate Slack app, no auto-start/auto-stop; see [Test Runner Bot](#test-runner-bot) |

> **Important:** Keep `web` scaled to exactly 1 machine. Run and prep state is held
> in-memory; multiple web machines will cause SSE streams to 404 on the wrong instance.
> If you need to scale, replace the in-memory `_runs`/`_preps`/`_app_questions` dicts with a shared store (Redis, etc.).

All three process groups share the same Docker image and all Fly secrets.

**Required secrets:**

| Secret | Description |

## Maintaining the Agent

### If XML replacements start failing
Run with `--debug` to inspect `unpacked/word/document.xml`. Section text drifts
when `master.docx` is edited in Word — update known strings in `profile.md`. The
SSE `done` event now includes a `replacements_warning` field if < 70% of edits
succeeded, so the web UI can surface it without requiring a log review.

### If cover letter voice drifts
Edit `profile.md` → "Voice & Tone Rules" and "DO NOT" sections.

### If framing angle is consistently wrong for a role type
Edit `CLAUDE.md` → "Common Role Type → Framing Angle Reference" table.

### If interview prep content is too verbose
The prompt in `apply.py` (`generate_interview_prep`) has hard `MAX N WORDS` limits
per field. Tighten these if Claude is still over-generating.

### If interview prep proof points reference old roles
The recency rule is enforced in the prompt: only roles/projects dated within the
last 10 years, per the dates in the user's own resume — no hardcoded employer list.

### If Google Drive token expires
The token is refreshed automatically and persisted to Tigris (`system/gdrive_token.json`) so it survives container restarts. If it's fully revoked (e.g. after revoking app access in Google Account settings), re-authorize:
```bash
rm ~/.config/job-apply/gdrive_token.json
python3 setup_gdrive.py
fly secrets set GDRIVE_TOKEN_JSON="$(cat ~/.config/job-apply/gdrive_token.json)"
# Then clear the stale Tigris copy so the new token takes precedence on next boot:
fly ssh console -C "python3 -c \"from scripts import storage; storage.delete_text('system/gdrive_token.json')\""
fly deploy --app job-apply-corey
```

### If webhook deliveries are being blocked
The SSRF guard runs at both write time and delivery time. A `Delivery blocked` error
in the delivery log means the URL resolved to a private/internal IP at delivery time
(possible DNS rebinding). Update the webhook URL to a public endpoint.

### Webhook secret rotation
Webhook secrets are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using a key derived from `SESSION_SECRET`.
If you rotate `SESSION_SECRET`, existing webhook secrets will fail to decrypt (delivery
will silently send unsigned requests). Re-save each webhook via `PUT /api/admin/webhooks/{id}`
with the secret to re-encrypt under the new key.
